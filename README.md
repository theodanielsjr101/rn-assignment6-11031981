# React Native Shopping App
This project is a simple React Native application designed to demonstrate the implementation of navigation, data storage, and the use of images in a simple shopping app.

## Overview
The application consists of two main screens the HomeScreen and the CheckoutScreen. In this app users can view a list of products on the Home screen and navigate to the Checkout screen to see a summary of their selected items.

### HomeScreen

The HomeScreen displays a list of products using a FlatList. Each product has an image, title, and price. There are also three icons at the top of the screen for additional functionalities like adding items, filtering, and viewing the list on the app.

### Checkout Screen
The CheckoutScreen displays a summary of selected items with their images, titles, and prices, along with the total estimated cost.

## Data Storage
Currently, the data (products and their details) are stored statically within the component files.
